Installation of vdrpbd daemon
---------------------------------

vdrpbd is a "self-containing" perl script. In theory no installation
is needed. To simplify the installation process, a simple Makefile has been
added nonetheless. If you use it, you also get man pages installed, which are
autogenerated from the POD documentation provided with vdrpbd.

To install vdrpbd, type

make install

To uninstall, you may use

make uninstall

If you just call "make", then anything, the Makefile does, is to generate the
man pages.

The recommended call to package vdrpbd would be:

make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/path/to/packagedir install

There is an optional dependency to the Net::DBus Perl module. It is used to
inhibit the power key on systemd based Linux systems, so systemd doesn't handle
the key on its own.
