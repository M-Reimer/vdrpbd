vdrpbd Revision History
-----------------------

2013-03-27: Version 0.0.1

- Initial revision.

2013-04-26: Version 0.1.0

- Added template for /etc/vdrpbd.conf
- Time range and number of keypresses for emergency reboot now configurable

2015-01-09: Version 1.0.0

- vdrpbd now tries to get exclusive access to the power button device.
  This fixes a problem with softhddevice which forwards all keyboard events to
  VDR. This made it impossible to cancel a shutdown by pressing "power" again.

2019-07-21: Version 2.0.0

- Kodi support
- Second candidate for power button device path added
