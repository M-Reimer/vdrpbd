VDR ACPI power button handling daemon (vdrpbd)
----------------------------------------------

vdrpbd is meant to be used as a replacement to the usually used "acpid", for
VDR based HTPC systems. As it is developed specially for VDR systems.

Features:
- Faster than acpid with all the required external scripts.
- Emergency reboot feature. You don't loose the power button as safe emergency
  exit button. Just press it four times within three seconds and a clean reboot
  is triggered.
- Very easy to set up. If you want, you can just copy the "vdrpbd" file to your
  VDR system and execute it. VDR should react to the power button immediately!
- Systemd integration. If systemd is detected, then vdrpbd tries to register
  itself as "power button inhibitor". The module "Net::DBus" is required for
  this to work.
  Note that this requires systemd version 201 or later and vdrpbd has to be
  started by systemd (systemctl start vdrpbd):

  For older systemd versions you have to add the following line to your
  /etc/systemd/logind.conf:

  HandlePowerKey=ignore
